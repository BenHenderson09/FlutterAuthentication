# FlutterAuthentication
This application is a full authentication system, it is intended to be used as a quickstart for producing any applications
that require user auth.

## Program Details
- Built with Flutter
- Uses Firebase
- Supports Android*
- Registration, Login, Logout and password reset capabilities

( * ) : This could easily be made cross-platform, but for building ios apps with firebase,
Apple requires that the ios-specific code is edited using their
Xcode software, and this is only available on Apple devices. I have a PC.

## Usage
To try it out, just go to the APK folder and download the app. For development go to the authentication folder and work
from there. 

Note: a "key.properties" file must be set up to sign the apk with a keystore and a "google-services.json" must be added to interact with 
your firebase database.
